# DSA Practice – Java

This repository contains my step-by-step practice of Data Structures and Algorithms using Java.
Each phase focuses on building strong fundamentals with clear logic and clean code.

---

##Phase 1: Arrays – Basics
Covered:
- Array input and output
- Finding min, max, and sum
- Counting elements based on conditions
- Checking if an array is sorted
- Basic problem-solving patterns

---

##Phase 2: Arrays – Core Patterns
Covered:
- Frequency counting
- Duplicate detection (using HashSet)
- Second largest element
- Array rotation
- Reversing arrays
- Applying HashMap and HashSet where appropriate

---

##Phase 3: Strings – Fundamentals
Covered:
- Character traversal
- Vowel and consonant counting
- String reversal
- Palindrome checking
- Character frequency using HashMap

Each problem includes comments explaining **why** a particular data structure or approach was used,
so future reference is easy.
