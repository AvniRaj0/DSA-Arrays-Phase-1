# DSA Practice – Arrays

This repository documents my step-by-step learning of **Data Structures and Algorithms in Java**, with a focus on understanding patterns and clean implementation.

---

## Phase 1: Array Fundamentals
**Goal:** Become comfortable with basic array operations and input handling.

### Topics Covered
- Array traversal
- Find maximum and minimum element
- Sum of elements (accumulator pattern)
- Count elements greater than X
- Count even and odd numbers
- Check if array is sorted
- User input using `Scanner`

---

## Phase 2: Core Array Patterns
**Goal:** Learn how to *think* while solving array problems.

### Patterns Learned
- Frequency counting using `HashMap`
- Detecting duplicates using `HashSet`
- Tracking multiple values (largest & second largest)
- Early exit logic
- Left rotation of array
- Reversing array using two pointers
- Handling edge cases and debugging index errors

---

## Language & Tools
- **Language:** Java  
- **IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA  
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub  

---

## Progress
- ✅ Phase 1 completed
- ✅ Phase 2 completed
- ⏳ Phase 3 (Strings) – upcoming
